## Purpose of the project

There was given a starter project with some HTML and CSS styling that displayed a static version of the Memory Game project. 

I have converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

The starter project can be found in the [Udacity Fend Project Memory Game](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

## Memory Game Logic

The game randomly shuffles the cards. The user will use the mouse to click on the cards. He wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

## Game Functionalities

| Criteria              | Specifications    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Congratulations Popup | When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if he wants to play again. The popup will also display: - how much time it took to win the game - what the star rating was. |
| Restart Button        | It allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating. |
| Star Rating           | The game displays a star rating from 1-3 that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, the user has 3 stars. After 10 wrong moves, the user has only 2 stars and after 20 wrong moves, he has only 1 star. |
| Timer                 | When the player starts a game, the timer also starts. When the game is won, the timer stops. |
| Move Counter          | Game displays the current number of moves the user has made. |
